I should traverse the string increasing a counter everytime a new character is
encountered and also add it to a hash map, resetting the hash map and counter everytime a previously 
encountered character is met again (by looking it up in the hash map) and 
update the size if it is more than previous size 

add first char to hash map and counter = 1 and size = 1
look up next char in hash map
if not found => new char => add it to hash map, counter++
else found => update size if counter > size and then set counter = 1, clear hash map
